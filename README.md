# Logistic Regression Model
## Heart attack prediction Logistic Regression Model on Jupyter Notebook
### About this dataset

Heart attack prediction is a dataset availble on Kaggle.com. This dataset consists different parameters like blood sugar,age,maximum heart rate achieved and etc. 

### Task Performed :-
1. Importing the required libraries
2. Importing the dataset into pandas dataframe
3. Checked the data for null values. No null values observed
4. Plotted the distribution plot for all columns to check whether the given data is normally distributed or not.
5. Checked the graph if any 0 value of blood suagr. Not observed any.
6. Done the train,test split.
7. Imported the logisticregression library and fitted the model on x_train and y_train values.
8. Predict the y values using x_test values.
9. Calculated the accuracy score values.
10. Calcaulted the confusion matrix and plotted the confustion matrix for y_test,y_pred values.
11. Calcaulted the Accuracy,Precision,Recall and f1 values.
12. Imported the roc_curve,roc_auc_score library and obtained the auc value.
13. Calculated the y_pred_prob using .predict_proba method.
14. Calculated the fpr,tpr and threshold value.
15. Plotted the ROC cauve with fpr,tpr and threshold
